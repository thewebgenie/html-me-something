		<p>As my heart pumped hard, all I could hear was the roar of people cheering in the stands. I couldn't even hear the other players voices. A timeout was called with 4 seconds left in the 4th, and the winning fieldgoal was only a 40 yard kick away.</p>
		<p>You might think I was the kicker's teammate.  However, you would be wrong. I was a nobody, enjoying the game at the local sports bar. The only difference was that, unlike my friend, I had paid money to enter a large fantasy football tournament with a million dollar top prize.</p>
		<p>And lucky for me I had our team's kicker on my squad. I was sitting in 10th place, and I was about 10 seconds awa/y from either going home with 10 grand or 1 million.</p>
		<p>As the ball left the kicker's foot and sailed through the air, I watched in disbelief as the ball bounced off the crossbar and went through the uprights. My friends rushed toward me, and s/uddently I awoke in utter/ sadness. IT WAS ALL A DREAM!</p>
		<p>While this is not a real story, playing fantasy sports is a daily hobby of mine</p>
