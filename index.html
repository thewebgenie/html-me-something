		<p>As my heart pumped hard, all I could hear was the roar of people cheering in the stands. I couldn't even hear the other players voices. A timeout was called with 4 seconds left in the 4th, and the winning fieldgoal was only a 40 yard kick away.You might think I was the kicker's teammate.  However, you would be wrong. I was a nobody, enjoying the game at the local sports bar. The only difference was that, unlike my friend, I had paid money to enter a large fantasy football tournament with a million dollar top prize. And lucky for me I had our team's kicker on my squad. I was sitting in 10th place, and I was about 10 seconds awa/y from either going home with 10 grand or 1 million. As the ball left the kicker's foot and sailed through the air, I watched in disbelief as the ball bounced off the crossbar and went through the uprights. My friends rushed toward me, and s/uddently I awoke in utter/ sadness. IT WAS ALL A DREAM! While this is not a real story, playing fantasy sports is a daily hobby of mine, and millions of other people. So what exactly is this phenomena all about?</p>
		<p>Daily fantasy sports (DFS) are a subset of fantasy sport games. As with traditional fantasy sports games, players compete against others by building a team of professional athletes from a particular league or competition while remaining under a salary cap, and earn points based on the actual statistical performance of the players in real-world competitions. Daily fantasy sports are an accelerated variant of traditional fantasy sports that are conducted over short-term periods, such as a week or single day of competition, as opposed to those that are played across an entire season. Daily fantasy sports are typically structured in the form of paid competitions typically referred to as a "contest"; winners receive a share of a pre-determined pot funded by their entry fees. A portion of entry fee payments go to the provider as rake revenue.</p>

<p>In the United States, the daily fantasy sports industry is dominated by two competing services: the New York-based FanDuel, and the Boston-based DraftKings. Both companies were established as venture capital-backed startup companies, received funding from investment firms, sports broadcasters, leagues, and team owners, and became known for the aggressive marketing of their services. As of September 2015, both companies have an estimated value of at least $1 billion, and control 95% of the U.S. DFS market. The two primarily compete against smaller DFS services, such as Fantasy Aces and Yahoo! Sports.[5][6] The popularity of the daily fantasy format has been credited to its convenience in comparison to season-length games, as well as the focus on major cash prizes in the promotion of these services. Daily fantasy has also been credited with helping to improve television viewership and engagement with sports.</p>

<p>Daily fantasy sports have faced notable legal challenges, including disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians and other critics have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing the performance of their selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game of skill, as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.</p>

<p>In the United States, the legality of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS is a form of illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.</p>
